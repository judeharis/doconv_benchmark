- Check why padding does not work properly (verify if discrepancy is due to output tensor indexing or weight placement)
- Add MM2IM to this infrastructure (extend generator + project creation path)
- Verify correctness with PyTorch reference (introduce comparison harness producing numeric deltas)
- Collate synthesis & latency metrics into timestamped comparison directories
- Add JSON summary export for each `compare-results` run
